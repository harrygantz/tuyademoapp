    <h1>Harry's Web API Demo App</h1>
    <p class="lead">
        Thank you for checking out my app. You mentioned that we had total freedom to do what we wanted, so I thought it would be fun to toss up a quick and dirty.NET web app
        instead of a console app. This app gives you the ability to get the data remotely by connecting to an Azure SQL Database (<a href="https://tuyademoapi20200106100020.azurewebsites.net/">check it out here</a>). I didn't have much experience using
        Azure, so I thought it would be fun to try to deploy a basic web app, connect to a remote db server for this exercise. I set up the web.config to work off my local SQL db as
        well so you can do that if you have data you wanted to run on your machine instead...
